# My Minitomo

Are you a fan of DnD 5e? Yes? That's great!

And do you like playing with spellcasters? Yes again! What a nice news!

But when playing, you get lost by the amount of data you have to learn to deal with everything? Yes, that's what I'm trying to solve here!

This project let us create a minitomo with personalized pictures so you can print and use the cards at you game and avoid getting lost.

Much easier now right? So let's get started!

## How to use it?
There are a few steps to configure it correctly.

### Pre-requirements
1. Install nodejs (at least version v16.14.0 - use other versions at you choice)
1. Install Vue Cli Service
1. Chrome Browser (didn't have time to test on other browsers yet)
1. Install git (since you have to clone it somehow)

### How to run it
1. Cloning this repo by using the clone button
1. At the repo folder, run `npm install`
1. Now just run `npm run serve` to start the inital server
1. An url like http://localhost:8080/ will be show at your screen. Click on it to opne it on Chrome.

## How this was projected?
There were several drivers for this project to be born. The first is a drastically difficult experience as a level 4 Dragonborn Sorcerer where I keep forgeting what I can do of cool.

The second is the desire to learn new skills. So there is where I choose to use Vue3 as the main technology for it.

## Wanna help this project? 
### I'd like a new feature
1. Use and abuse from the issues tab. I will try my best to add the features you want.
1. Try also testing with different configurations. That would help me a lot too!

### I wanna code!
1. Fork this repository
1. Create a new branch for your work
1. Push up any changes to your branch, and open a pull request. Don't feel it needs to be perfect â€” incomplete work is totally fine. Remember, I'm a newbie in Vue and made this thing, so any help is valuable!

### I'm a programmer expert and like to judge!
As I said before, I'm a newbie in Vue. So issuing the best practices and also how should I refactor it to be better is totally fine and I would love it.
